# README - Logistics Case Study

Welcome to my case study! 
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the presented logistics operation, focusing on improving efficiency, optimizing delivery times, and enhancing overall performance.

Please visit the [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f7d0f7ed-6e79-4bef-a5ad-fbd547b29b7d) I built to a more comprehensive and visual perspective of the study.

The processing and exploration were performed [here]([https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/f7d0f7ed-6e79-4bef-a5ad-fbd547b29b7d)](https://github.com/caiocsn/Logistics-Case/blob/main/Processing%20and%20Exploration.ipynb)! Feel free to leave a feedback.

## Objective
The primary objective of this case study is to identify and address challenges faced by the logistics operation, ultimately aiming to achieve cost savings, streamline processes, and deliver exceptional customer service.


## Key questions

### Based on the data already analyzed, here are the recommended steps to reduce the average delivery time to 3 days:

1. Focus on improving order processing time: By reducing processing time, it is possible to potentially shave off 3 days from the overall shipping time.

2. Optimize carrier/provider attribution strategy: Based on the analysis conducted, identify areas for improvement in the carrier/provider attribution strategy. Implement optimization techniques that can enhance the allocation process, leading to more efficient and timely deliveries. This strategy holds significant potential for substantial reduction in delivery time.

3. Pressure providers to maintain high service level: Maintain strict standards and enforce accountability by exerting pressure on the providers to consistently meet and exceed the expected service level. Continuous monitoring and communication with the providers can ensure that service levels are maintained at a high standard.

### If you were to ask the engineering teams to gather more data, the following information would be beneficial and why:

1. SLA agreement tables: By obtaining and analyzing the SLA agreement tables, you can gain deeper insights into the specific service level commitments, metrics, and penalties outlined in the agreements. This data will help assess the current performance against agreed-upon standards and identify areas that require improvement or renegotiation.

2. Customer average income generation for each region: Gathering data on the average income generation of customers in different regions provides valuable context. It helps estimate the potential financial impact of delayed shipments, allowing for a more informed assessment of the cost associated with delivery time reductions.

3. Warehouse data: Obtaining detailed warehouse data, such as inventory turnover rates, order fulfillment efficiency, and processing times, enables a comprehensive analysis of fulfillment operations. This data can help identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement within the warehouse, contributing to overall delivery time reduction efforts.

### What were the problems, how did you find them and what should we do to fix them?

1. The dataset had some quality issues, I've addressed most of them in processing notebook. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback. Happy exploring and best of luck in improving your logistics operation!
